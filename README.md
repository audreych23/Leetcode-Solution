# Leetcode-Solution
This is the solutions for questions in leetcode, the file name indicates question number and question name.

There might be two solutions in some files and not all solutions are optimized (for now).
In the future, time complexity and space complexity will also be added in the comments for the solutions.

**Notes**: all solutions are in c++ and solutions that have comments in the commit message have other solutions that I haven't tried, or something that I want to learn more on. (For me to go back to it)
